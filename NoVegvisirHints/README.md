# No Vegvisir Hints

Created by [OrianaVentureMod@gmail.com](https://github.com/OrianaVenture/VentureValheim).

## Introduction

Disables the map pins from Vegvisir runestones in the world. Interacting with boss location runestones and the Hildir map table still adds pins as expected.

## Installation

This mod is client side only and has no configuration options. Does not need to be on the server.

## Changelog

### 0.2.0

* First official release.
