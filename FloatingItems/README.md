# Venture Floating Items

Created by [OrianaVentureMod@gmail.com](https://github.com/OrianaVenture/VentureValheim).

## Introduction

Makes previously sinkable items float on water, or floating items sinkable. Configurable.

## Features

Allows you to make items that usually sink the ability to float on water (or tar), and vice versa. To make items sink add their prefab names to the "SinkingItems". To make items float toggle the following categories you want, or add the specific item prefab names to the "FloatingItems" config list:

* FloatEverything: Floats everything except for items listed in the "SinkingItems" config
* FloatTrophies: Will add the floating ability to any item that contains "trophy" in it's prefab name
* FloatMeat: Will add the floating ability to any item that contains "meat" in it's prefab name
* FloatHides: Will add the floating ability to the different hides and fabrics
* FloatGearAndCraftable: Will add the floating ability to any item that contains a recipe (can be crafted by a player), and other gear like items bought from Haldor and meads
* FloatTreasure: Will add the floating ability to Coins, Ruby, Amber, AmberPearl, and SilverNecklace

If an item is included in the "SinkingItems" list it will be excluded from automatic item discovery when turning on the other config toggles. The mod defaults will add SerpentScale to the "FloatingItems" list, and will add BronzeNails and IronNails to the "SinkingItems" list.

## Installation

This mod needs to be on all clients to work properly. Config Syncing is included with Jotunn. Install on the server to enforce the same mod configuration for all players. Live changes to the configurations should take immediate effect but items already on the ground will not update until reloaded or picked up.

## Changelog

Moved to new file, it will appear as a new tab on the thunderstore page.
