# Logout Tweaks

Created by [OrianaVentureMod@gmail.com](https://github.com/OrianaVenture/VentureValheim).

## Introduction

Saves and applies some status effects (such as Rested) from your last logout.

## Features

On logout saves some of your current status effects to the player file to reapply them on next login including:

* Rested
* Wet
* Poison
* Burning
* Vanilla Potions
* Death effects
* Slimed & Tared
* Boss Powers

As of version 0.5.0 the poison and burning status effects will track their damage and time remaining, preventing people from logging out to cheat death. Also, reapplying custom status effects from other mods is no longer automatically supported.

## Installation

This mod is client side only and has no configuration options. Does not need to be on the server.

## Changelog

Moved to new file, it will appear as a new tab on the thunderstore page.
