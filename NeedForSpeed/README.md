# Need For Speed

Created by [OrianaVentureMod@gmail.com](https://github.com/OrianaVenture/VentureValheim).

## Introduction

Detects when the player is on cleared ground (a path) and applies a speed boost multiplier. Separate configuration values for jogging and running.

## Features

Gives you options to increase (or decrease) the speed the player jogs and runs on paths. This multiplier will work on paths created by the hoe and pickaxe, as well as paths created by naturally spawning structures (and tar pits?).

* Ability to configure the run and jog speed multipliers individually.

## Installation

This mod needs to be on the client to work. Config Syncing is included with Jotunn. Install on the server to enforce the same mod configuration for all players.
