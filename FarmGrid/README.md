# Venture Farm Grid

Created by [OrianaVentureMod@gmail.com](https://github.com/OrianaVenture/VentureValheim).

## Introduction

Plant in a customizable grid for perfect evenly spaced crops. Inspired by Farm Grid by Sarcen.

## Features

This mod is a remake of Sarcen's Farm Grid with more built in support for vanilla crops and other mods without needing additional configuration.

1. Start by placing a crop with the cultivator to activate the grid.
2. Swivel to the desired spot and place your second crop to finalize the grid.
3. Begin creating a perfectly square field.

This mod supports fixed snap angles or free swivel placement. By default fixed snapping is enabled. To enable free swiveling set the FarmGridFixedPartitions configuration to 0.

### Configurations

* FarmGridFixedPartitions: Fixed number of partitions for initial snapping angles. Vanilla uses 16 for build pieces, 0 allows free rotation.
* PlantSpacing: Extra spacing to add to all plants in addition to the plant's needed growth space.
* FarmGridSections: Amount of grid squares to draw from the center. Limited to 10 maximum.
* FarmGridYOffset: Grid offset from the ground.
* FarmGridColor: Color of the grid
* CustomPlants: Additional non-Plant prefabs and overrides for default values.

## Installation

This mod is client side only and changes made to the configurations will only affect your client. Live updates to the configs will take immediate effect.

## Changelog

### 0.1.0
