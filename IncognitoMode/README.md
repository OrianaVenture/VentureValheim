## Introduction

Roleplaying mod that changes the Player display name if their face is hidden by certain helmets. Configurable.

## Features

This is a roleplaying mod aimed at making in-game experiences more realistic. Come across a player in a full padded armor set? Well I wouldn't be able to tell who they are either! Configure the display name of these mystery characters with the HiddenDisplayName config, and pick which helmets can hide a player name with HiddenByItems config. Players will have to take off their helmets to reveal their identities! Good luck knowing who robbed you!

All players will have to have this mod installed for hidden names to work 100% of the time. Any player who does not have this installed will not have their name hidden (even for players with the mod installed).

ServerSync is included. Install on the server to enforce the same mod configuration for all players.
