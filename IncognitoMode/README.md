## Introduction

Roleplaying mod that changes the Player display name if their face is hidden by certain helmet, shoulder, utility, or trinket items. Configurable.

## Features

This is a roleplaying mod aimed at making in-game experiences more realistic. Come across a player in a full padded armor set? Well I wouldn't be able to tell who they are either! Configure the display name of these mystery characters with the HiddenDisplayName config, and pick which items can hide a player name with HiddenByItems config. Players will have to take off their items to reveal their identities! Good luck knowing who robbed you!

If you wish to hide the entire player hud (as if that player is sneaking) set the HideHud configuration to True.

Currently, equipped helmet, shoulder, utility, and trinket items are supported. Will work with custom items added by other mods given they are of one of these categories.

## Installation

All players will have to have this mod installed for hidden names to work 100% of the time. Any player who does not have this installed will not have their name hidden (even for players with the mod installed).

This mod needs to be on all clients to work properly. Config Syncing is included with Jotunn. Install on the server to enforce the same mod configuration for all players.
