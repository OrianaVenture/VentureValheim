# Reely Good Rod

Created by [OrianaVentureMod@gmail.com](https://github.com/OrianaVenture/VentureValheim).

## Introduction

Reduces stamina usage of fishing rods when reeling in fish by half.

## Features

Fishing is hard, but doesn't have to be! Makes it easier to fish by reducing stamina usage of reeling the fishing rod by half. Should work on modded fishing rods.

## Fishing Tips

* Stamina drain is larger when the fish is fighting you (wiggling or swimming), avoid reeling during this animation.
* Eat your highest stamina foods while fishing.
* Stamina meads are your friend. Consume once your stamina is almost drained, wait for the bar to refill, then catch that fish!
* If you are a vegan you can throw your fish back in the water; mildly traumatized, but they will live.
