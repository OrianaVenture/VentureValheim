# Remember Location

Created by [OrianaVentureMod@gmail.com](https://github.com/OrianaVenture/VentureValheim).

## Introduction

Remembers your last logout location so you can start in the same spot between different worlds.

## Features

In vanilla your last logout location is tracked per individual server/world. For "shadow" servers this can be a problem. If you have two or more servers of identical worlds and want players to log into the same place when hopping between them this is the mod for you. Pair this mod with Multiplayer Tweaks to also set a default spawn point when logout data does not yet exist.

What can you expect? This mod will overwrite every known logout point in your player profile for every known world on that character. Consequentially, the first time a player joins a new world they will use the default spawn location because this data does not yet exist. If you jump between servers that have different maps you might run into some issues: This mod can potentially spawn you in hostile biomes or the middle of the ocean. If your world seeds match but the player structures do not you can potentially be spawned inside or under someone else's base. Depending on what mods you are using you might get stuck somewhere! Do not use singleplayer characters on servers using this mod if you would like to maintain your spawn points on those worlds!

This mod does not prevent cheating. In some cases it can allow cheaters to spawn inside places they shouldn't be.

This mod can cause a lot of pain and heartache, I have warned you, please also warn your server players. GLHF!
