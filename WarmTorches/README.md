# Warm Torches

Created by [OrianaVentureMod@gmail.com](https://github.com/OrianaVenture/VentureValheim).

## Introduction

Torch items will prevent you from getting the Cold debuff.

## Features

Wielding a torch (or lantern) in either hand will take away the Cold debuff caused by environmental factors unless in a freezing biome. For example, a torch warms you up at night in meadows but does not keep you warm in the mountains.

Should be compatible with custom items that are using the Torch ItemType.

## Installation

This mod is client side only and has no configuration options. Does not need to be on the server.

## Changelog

### 0.1.0

* First release
