# Pathside Assistance

Created by [OrianaVentureMod@gmail.com](https://github.com/OrianaVenture/VentureValheim).

## Introduction

Adds additional path and cultivator options to help keep the terrain more natural in your world.

## Features

Tired of spending time fixing your paths and garden because of unnatural looking terrain changes? This mod adds additional options to the hoe and cultivator based on existing piece entries. Now you can make nicer paths in your world without the mess flattening and smoothing causes.

All new pieces will have the localized name of the original piece plus "ALT" (short for alternative) added to name to identify them. Pieces to only raise or paint the terrain will have an alternative piece that is twice as large as the original including: raise ground, pathen, and grass restoration. All other terrain modifying pieces that flatten or smooth the ground will have an alternative with no terrain changes except the paint including: paved road, and cultivate.

This mod discovers pieces dynamically and should support other piece options added to the hoe and cultivator by other mods. Depending on what other mods you have installed this mod may behave differently than when using it alone.

## Installation
